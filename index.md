### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 is one of my favorite labs because it was the first lab in my computer science journey. Like everyone, the "Hello World" code is what introduces us to the field of coding in c++ and as my first, It will mark a point important in my life as it was the beggining to my career. The lab itself was confusing to me at first as I didn't even know how to access it but looking back at it now, I can see how much I have developed.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 is another one of my favorites. In this lab my partner and I were tasked with coding a program that would convert mass sizes, such as ml to tsp. The reason I liked this lab was because it was one of the labs that taught me to use call functions. To be able to use code from different files is something that impressed me and improved my knowledge in c++.
* Lab 8 

    Lab 8, part 1 also makes the list of the labs I personally liked. The reason being that it allowed me to learn how I could use user-made inputs and apply them into a program. The lab itself was simple but it introduced me to the aspect of how user inputs can be used into more complex programs such as calculators.
